## Features

- **Multiple Kubeconfig Support** - Manage multiple K3s/Kubernetes clusters from a single config
- **Real-time Pod Monitoring** - Live-updating pod list with status colors
- **Streaming Logs** - View and follow pod logs in real-time (like `kubectl logs -f`)
- **Pod Operations** - Delete and restart pods with confirmation dialogs
- **SSH Integration** - Connect to nodes via SSH and run crictl commands
- **Container Runtime Inspection** - View containers directly via crictl on nodes
- **Search in Logs** - Find specific entries in log output with highlighting
- **Keyboard-driven** - Efficient navigation with vim-style keybindings

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LywwKkA-aD/k4s.git
cd k4s

# Build and install
make install

# Or just build
make build
./build/k4s
```

### From Release

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/LywwKkA-aD/k4s/releases) page.

```bash
# Linux (amd64)
curl -LO https://github.com/LywwKkA-aD/k4s/releases/download/v0.1.0/k4s-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf k4s-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv k4s-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/k4s

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -LO https://github.com/LywwKkA-aD/k4s/releases/download/v0.1.0/k4s-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf k4s-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
sudo mv k4s-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/k4s
```

## Configuration

k4s uses a configuration file at `~/.k4s/config.yaml`. On first run, a default configuration is created.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
kubeconfigs:
  - name: "local-k3s"
    path: "~/.kube/config"
    default: true
  - name: "production"
    path: "~/.kube/prod-config"

ssh_hosts:
  - name: "k3s-node-1"
    host: "192.168.1.100"
    user: "admin"
    key_path: "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    port: 22
  - name: "k3s-node-2"
    host: "192.168.1.101"
    user: "admin"
    key_path: "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

## Views

### Namespaces View (`0`)
Browse and select Kubernetes namespaces. Shows namespace status and age.

### Pods View (`1`)
List all pods in the selected namespace with:
- Pod name
- Ready containers (X/Y)
- Status (color-coded)
- Restart count
- Age

Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds.

### Pod Details (Enter on pod)
Detailed information about a pod including:
- Metadata (labels, annotations)
- Container information
- Resource requests/limits
- Recent events

### Log Viewer (`l`)
View pod logs with streaming support:
- Follow mode for real-time logs
- Multi-container support
- Timestamp toggle
- Search with highlighting

### SSH Hosts View (`9`)
Connect to K3s nodes via SSH to run crictl commands:
- View containers on the node
- Inspect container logs
- See node system information

## SSH Authentication

k4s supports two methods for SSH authentication:

1. **SSH Agent** (Recommended) - If you have ssh-agent running with keys loaded:
   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent)
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. **Passphrase Prompt** - If your key requires a passphrase and ssh-agent isn't available, k4s will prompt for it.

## Logs

Debug logs are written to `~/.k4s/k4s.log`. Useful for troubleshooting connection issues.
